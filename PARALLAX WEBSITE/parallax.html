        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>A parallax website uses an optical illusion in which background elements move slower than foreground elements as a user scrolls, creating a 3D-like effect with a sense of depth and immersion. This engaging visual technique is used to make websites more dynamic, visually appealing, and effective for storytelling, guiding visitors through content with layered visuals moving at different speeds.  </p>

            <li><b>Differential Scrolling Speeds:</b> Background images or layers are designed to move at a slower pace than foreground content and text as the user scrolls down the page. </li>
            <li><b>Illusion of Depth:</b> This contrast in movement creates the appearance of layers and space between the foreground and background, making it seem as though the website has a three-dimensional quality. </li>

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s.</p>
